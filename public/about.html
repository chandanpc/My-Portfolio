<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Chandan Gupta, and I'm a 30-year-old full-stack web developer with a passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly websites.
  I have several years of experience working with a variety of technologies, including Java, JavaScript, PL/SQL, Spring, Hibernate,
  Spring Boot, microservices, and HTML, among others.</p>

<p>One thing that sets me apart is my love of learning. I'm always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set 
  and stay on top of the latest trends in web development. Whether I'm taking an online course, attending a workshop, 
  or simply experimenting with new tools and techniques, I'm always looking for ways to improve and grow as a developer.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can usually find me exploring the great outdoors, reading a good book, or spending time with family and friends.
  I believe in living life to the fullest and making the most of every opportunity that comes my way.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read my "About Me" section. If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to drop me a line!</p>
